## Playing The Game

Experience the beginning of entrepreneurship! This role-playing game will allow you to assume the character of a business owner while taking you through a series of scenarios that test your business savvy. Your company may not last long if you continuously make poor decisions as CEO, resulting in an early end to the game. Alternatively, if your company survives through 5 phases of challenges, your overall success will be rated based on your business decisions.
