## Playing The Game

Experience the beginning of entrepreneurship! This role-playing game will allow you to assume the character of a business owner while taking you through a series of scenarios that test your business savvy. Your company may not last long if you continuously make poor decisions as CEO, resulting in an early end to the game. Alternatively, if your company survives through 5 phases of challenges, your overall success will be rated based on your business decisions.

## Game Planning & Building
1. Game mapping was slightly difficult to ensure phases made sense based on decision options.
2. JavaScript research as well as trial and error took up most of project time. This resulted in less time to focus on css of game.
3. Tested decision click function after each phase code to ensure proper phases were being shown.

## Final Thoughts
This project was a huge learning experience and really challenged the skills I've acquired in class so far. My main takeaways is to not overcomplicate the process and implement functions in a way that makes more sense so I can fully understand and manipulate as needed.

A lot of time could have been saved if I didn't refresh every time I wrote a new line of code, which could have been allocated in other ways to make the game more advanced.
